Dual output adjustable power supply based off of the SIC431 chip for high current output in a very small form factor and end-user choice of linear side regulator for low ripple output or standby power.

Applications: 
Robotics.
Portable and wearable electronics.
Low or high power applications.
Battery powered electronics.
Custom built small compute devices.

Features:
Dual output, switching and linear.
SIC431 based switching side.
End-user choice of linear regulator.
Tuneable or programmable switching side voltage output via potentiometer or bypass jumper.
Daisy-chain or fully separate supply to linear regulator configured by solderable jumpers.
Enable/Disable pin for switching side with optional pull up/down resistor pads.
VReady pin from switching side for sensitive electronics.

Warning: Higher Amperage draw will cause the board to reach temperatures not suitable for direct skin contact. An enclosure to prevent direct contact and a heatsink with sufficient cooling air should be used to reduce working temperature.
